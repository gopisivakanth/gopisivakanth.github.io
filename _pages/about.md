I am a principal researcher in the [Algorithms group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/algorithms-redmond/) at [Microsoft Research Redmond](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond). I graduated with a PhD in Theoretical Computer Science from [Princeton University](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/) in 2018. I completed my undergraduate studies at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) with a major in computer science and a minor in mathematics.

I am currently working on quantization of neural networks to reduce inference costs and on improving reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previously at Microsoft, I have worked on designing erasure codes for distributed storage and on differential privacy for generating synthetic data imitating private data and for training deep learning models on private data.
