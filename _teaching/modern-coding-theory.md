This graduate course is an introduction to modern topics in Coding Theory. Our goal is to introduce the basic concepts of error correcting codes, and then delve into some advanced topics. This was cotaught with [Anup Rao](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~anuprao/) in Fall 2019 at University of Washington. [Lecture Notes](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse599i/19au/schedule/)
